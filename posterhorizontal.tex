\begin{block}{Introduction}

\justify

Indicators of variability in material culture can explain how cultural processes evolve over time and space~\cite{lipo}. In particular, our study aims to analyse the changes in the large-scale amphorae production during the Roman Empire. This study explores the question of transmission on the learning techniques processes. Specifically, we are interested on understanding if pottery-making techniques were transmitted through vertical or horizontal social learning. If vertical transmission predominates in this process then amphorae made in nearby workshops may share more similar traits than amphorae from farthest workshops~\cite{bjo}. We also analysed the correlation between spatial distance and morphometric variation by exploring test. In this work we have explored the social learning processes associated with amphorae production through a combination of empirical analysis and theoretical exploration.

%Material culture variability allows us to interpret the change in the production processes~\cite{lycett}. In particular, this study is exploring this question by analyzing large-scale amphorae production during the Roman Empire. Specifically, we are interested on understanding if pottery-making techniques were transmitted thought vertical or horizontal social learning. If vertical is the one in use, amphorae made in nearby workshops might share more similar traits than amphorae made from farthest workshops, following isolation-by distance~\cite{bjo}.  We test it by observing the existence of a correlation between spatial distance and morphometric variation. In this work we have explored the social learning processes associated with amphorae production through a combination of empirical analysis and theoretical exploration.

\begin{block}{Materials}

\justify
We have analyzed 470 amphorae (fig.\ref{fig:betica}~(b)) from 5 different workshops located in \emph{Baetica} (fig.\ref{fig:betica}~(a)). This province supplied a massive quantity of olive oil to the rest of the Empire from the Ist to the IIIrd centuries, and for this reason a large-scale infrastructure of amphorae production was developed here. The same amphoric type (Dressel 20) was produced in several workshops located along the course of the Guadalquivir river. A sample of 90 amphorae was chosen for each of the four analysed workshops. Eight different measures were taken for each amphorae, most of them focused on the rim as an indicator of more variability. 


%The workshops were selected from different sites of \emph{Baetica} province in order to know if morphometric distance was correlated with spatial distance\xavi{you can remove this sentence, you already said that they are from Baetica, and that the aim of the study is to see if variation is correlated with distance. A better phrasing:The same amphoric type (Dressel 20) was produced in several workshops located along the course of the Guadalquivir river}
%\xavi{A sample is the entire set of amphorae, not each amphora, so you can't say "90 sample".}

\justify
The pattern observed in the firsts 2 Principal Components suggests that amphorae from closer workshops tend to be more similar (see Figure~\ref{fig:pca}). In this case, the four closest workshops show variation on PC1 (i.e. Bel\'en, Delicias, Villaseca and Malpica) while Parlamento displays a distinctive pattern than the rest of workshops on PC2 values.

{\textbf{Model}}
\justify
We developed a model based on classical random drift~\cite{bentley2004randomdriftandculturechange} mimicking our original dataset. In this model, we define $5$ workshops all sharing the same production techniques $T^{0}$. 
Each workshop produces amphorae and changes their production techniques by: modifying their own techniques (Vertical Transmission, VT) or by copying one from another workshop (Horizontal Transmission, HT). 
%The probability that inovation occurs (the proba of a \emph{Vertical Transmission}, VT) is the same for everyone, whereas the probability that one workshop copies another (the proba of an \emph{Horizontal Transmission}, HT) depends on the distances between the workshops, distances that follow the positions given in the Fig.~\ref{fig:betica}.

The algorithm is the following:

To test the influence of HT and VT on the patterns observed we defined two models:\\
\hspace{5mm}{\footnotesize\textbf{VT}}: proba of random copy between workshop is set to~$0$. Changes come from Vertical transmission only.\\
\hspace{5mm}{\footnotesize\textbf{VT+HT}}: proba of random copy proportionnal to distance between workshops. Changes come from horizontal \emph{and} vertical transmission.\\
%Amphorae are describe by on trait and we look how this trait varies between each workshop at the end of the simulation.
Fig.~\ref{fig:resmod} shows that variation in production remains at the level of what we observe in the dataset only with the {\footnotesize\textbf{VT+HT}}~model.

\begin{block}{Discussion}
\justify

Empirical studies have identified variation on the learning processes among pottery workshops. We observe a variability correlated with spatial distance: the analysed morphometric traits show that the similarity between amphorae decrease with the spatial distance between the workshops they were produced.
The combination with theoretical model suggests that vertical transmission would be the most probable main cultural mechanism of learning at the beginning.This could be interpreted by the fact that pottery techniques were learned from master to disciple. After simulating, the variation of the morphological selected traits among workshops was higher in vertical transmission than the real data. A low contact between workshops (VT) stimulated a high variation in morphological traits. By contrast, a continuous contact between workshops  provided a low variability of traits.




%This could be interpreted by the fact that pottery techniques were learned from master to disciple and that disciples remained in the workshop where they were trained.
%The low different morphological traits among workshops do not seem proper of a low contact between potters from others workshops.
